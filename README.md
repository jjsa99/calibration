Calibraiton script simulation in python 

- 0. Camera models with Numpy and Matplotlib 
  - In this script we will experience different camera models and play with then in terms of rotations and translations.\
    This script is a condensation of the work done by [Mario Larcher](https://github.com/mnslarcher/camera-models) with some added features done by me.
    In order to run the program it's necessary to import the libraries used in the original project.( those can be find in the github)
